# Billing Alarms

Billing metrics are in the US East (N. Virginia) for all of AWS. This is an estimate of all the services in use on your account. It's good to set up a maximum threshold of `$` per month so when the limit is reached, you set a Simple Notification Service message off to an email that is monitored by you. This allows you to ensure none of the services used on Amazon Web Services costs you too much money.
